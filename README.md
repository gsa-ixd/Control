## Overview
[Control](https://canvas.gsa.ac.uk/courses/671/pages/control-overview?module_item_id=41512)

What other ways can we use to control a computer, other than simply using a keyboard and a mouse? This project seeks to explore a range of inputs using electronic hardware such as - buttons, switches, sliders, knobs - and how, when used singly and in combination, they can affect computer-based realtime environments.
 

We will explore the technicalities of how to build simple control circuits using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/arduino) - creating a ‘control device’ – and develop further our understanding of how to make responsive digital artworks. You will also be introduced to soldering and laser cutting techniques to aid your fabricating methods. This project has a focus on a physical three-dimensional resolve and you should consider how the 'control device' is developed in tandem with the realtime output so that there is a clear relationship between the two. 
 
The project is based around the keyword **control** and you should consider this word both in its literal and in its wider contexts - the notion of controlling; forced control; expressive control; control as having both positive and negative connotations.

### Class 01

- Arduino 101
- Digital Inputs & Outputs
- Analog Inputs & Outputs
- Serial Monitor

Circuit diagrams png files can be found [here:](https://github.com/gsa-ixd/Control/tree/master/Class01)<br>

**Homework** : Look at the [Interaction](http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp03/example-03-02-mouseX-mouseY) example then find or adapt an existing Processing sketch you made last year to utilises the mouse movement. Make sure you have it available for class 02.  

### Class 02
- What is Firmata?
- Communicating between Arduino and Processing
- Mapping, Constrain<br>

**Homework** : Look at the [Hold Button](http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp05/example-05-04-holdbutton) and [Switch Button](http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp05/example-05-05-switchbutton)example then find or adapt an existing Processing sketch you made last year to utilises the mousePress or keyPress function. Make sure you have it available for class 03.

### Class 03
- Controlling Outputs
- If Statements and Booleans
- Momentary and Latching logic
- Joining up Arduino circuits to Processing sketches<br>

**Homework** : Continue working on adapting existing Processing sketches from Y1. Try to join elements together by using Firmata to replace mouse and key functions with sliders and buttons. Make sure you bring the circuit you have worked on to class 04.

### Class 04
- Advanced Audio Visual Outputs
- Audio – dynamic gain, pan, rate, sample triggering
- Video control dynamic frame scrubbing, colour control, filters
- Combining multiple sketches into 1 scene using PGraphics<br>

**Homework** : This is the last of the practical workshops. take what you know and adapt the techniques to your own ideas and contexts. Check the canvas calendar for Sign-up Tutorial slots and Reviews.
