## Overview
[Control](https://canvas.gsa.ac.uk/courses/671/pages/control-overview?module_item_id=41512)

What other ways can we use to control a computer, other than simply using a keyboard and a mouse? This project seeks to explore a range of inputs using electronic hardware such as - buttons, switches, sliders, knobs - and how, when used singly and in combination, they can affect computer-based realtime environments.
 

We will explore the technicalities of how to build simple control circuits using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)and [Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/arduino) - creating a ‘control device’ – and develop further our understanding of how to make responsive digital artworks. You will also be introduced to soldering and laser cutting techniques to aid your fabricating methods. This project has a focus on a physical three-dimensional resolve and you should consider how the 'control device' is developed in tandem with the realtime output so that there is a clear relationship between the two. 
 
The project is based around the keyword **control** and you should consider this word both in its literal and in its wider contexts - the notion of controlling; forced control; expressive control; control as having both positive and negative connotations.
